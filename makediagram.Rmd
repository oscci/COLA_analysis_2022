## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
DiagrammeR::grViz("
                  digraph rmarkdown{
                  A -> B
                  }
                  ",height=200)


DiagrammeR::mermaid("
                    graph LR
                    A --> B
                    ",height=200)


a=23
b=45

grViz(diagram = "digraph flowchart {
  node [fontname = arial, shape = rectangle, color = grey, style = filled]
  tab1 [label = '@@1']
  tab2 [label = '@@2']
  tab3 [label = '@@3']
  
  tab1 -> tab2 -> tab3;
}
  
  [1]: paste0('Screening questions',':\\n','Aged 16-50')
  [2]: paste0('Step 1: Online battery',':\\n','Demographic questionnaire'  )  
  [3]: paste0('Step 2:   Functional TCD', ':\\n','At Oxford, Bangor, London, Lincoln, Lancaster, or UWA',':\\n','6 language tasks',':\\n','Planned N = 224',':\\n','Actual N = xxx')
  ")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
